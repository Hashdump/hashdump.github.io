<h1>We need a new logo!</h1>

<div style="width: 60%">
    <p>We think it's about time the face of our club's brand had a facelift. If you think you're up to the task, we want your help! Submit your reimagining of Hashdump's icon, and it could become the new official face of Hashdump. The winning designer will also recieve a free Yubikey as a token of our appreciation. Anyone is allowed and encouraged to enter, so don't be shy!</p>

    <h3>The rules:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Create your logo as a vector graphic (<code>.svg</code> <code>.ai</code>, etc.).</li>
        <li>Don't put anything blantantly offensive or distasteful in your design. This is going to become our new brand, after all, so follow CSU's principles of community and your common sense.</li>
        <li>When complete, send the vector file in an email with the subject "hashdump logo redesign" to <code>csuhashdump@gmail.com</code>. <strong>Include your name somewhere in the body, so we know who you are.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other than that, there are no restrictions. Be creative! We want your ideas even if you're not an expert, so again, don't be afraid to participate.</p>
    
    <p>Your designs will be passed by the Hashdump officers, and the logo that we feel looks and embodies the club's spirit best will be chosen as the winner. The designer behind the winning logo will be awarded a free Yubikey and have their work featured across this website and wherever else our brand ends up.</p>
