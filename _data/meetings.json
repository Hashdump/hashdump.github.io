What are they for? How can we use them? Will any of them help me make the perfect mac-n-cheese? We will attempt to answer at least two of those questions in this meeting! Come on by <a href='https://discord.gg/KfdWtGb'>our Discord server</a> to participate."

We went over some network worms (Klez, Nimda, Sality, Swen) that disguise themself and spread over e-mail or a networks shared files, and some ransomware (Petya and WannaCry) that encrypts your entire computer! All you needed to get your files back was a measly $300 in bitcoin. The meeting was educational and it was quite entertaining to see malware in action. See you next week!"
